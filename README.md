ruby-eh.rb
=======

One of the hardships about being Canadian is that most programming languages are quite simply rude. Descriptions like ‘imperative’ and ‘declarative’ are enough to fill even the most impolite of Canadians with a vague sense of discomfort. Fear no more! Ruby is the sort of language that addresses all these concerns, and adds a familiar, maple-syrupy feel to your code. 

You're one `load "ruby-eh.rb"` away from writing the correct and polite code you've always wanted. Here is a sample of what `ruby-eh.rb` can do for you:

### Polite code
```
giver "maple syrup".please.reverse.eh?
```

### French code
```
def articles_aleatoires(matrice)
    matrice.echantillon(1 + rand(matrice.compte))
end
```

### Canadian exceptions
```
# ArgumentError: uncaught throw ArgumentError. Take off, hoser.
```

### Unicode
```
if ☆ == ☂
    puts ☎
end
```

### Spaces in function names
```
take off
# >> If you don't mind, ♫ ♪ Coo loo coo coo, coo coo coo coo ♬ ♪
# => nil 
```

### Open issues
There is not a single reference to hockey, curling, or meeses, which by most Canadian standards is unacceptable.
